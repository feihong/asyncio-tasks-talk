# What

In this talk, I will be talking about starting, stopping, and displaying incremental data from long-running tasks in an asyncio-based web application.

The examples for this talk were made to run on [Muffin](https://github.com/klen/muffin), a high-level web framework built on top of [aiohttp](https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp).

^ The Muffin API, especially for defining routes and request handlers, seems to be modeled after the Flask API. But everything that works in aiohttp still works in Muffin.

---
# Why

You could just run tasks in Celery or Django Channels, so why bother with asyncio?

Depending on your circumstances, using asyncio can lead to

- A simpler architecture
- Less code
- Better performance

^ Simpler architecture: With Celery, you'd also also need to set up RabbitMQ and the Celery task runner. With Django Channels, you need to set up Redis.

^ Less code: You don't need to worry about interprocess communication and serialization. Tasks are just functions, and can accept any kind of argument.

^ Better performance: Asyncio tasks are much more scalable than threads. Because asyncio network operations don't block, you can have many more simultaneously open connections.

# Overview of asyncio concepts

- Coroutine object
- Coroutine function (async function)
- Task

---
# What is a coroutine object?

An "object [representing] a computation or an I/O operation (usually a combination) that will complete eventually"

Originally, coroutine objects were essentially glorified generators. Python 3.5 introduced native coroutine objects, which are created by coroutine functions using the `async def` syntax.

^ Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html

^ Source: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#rationale-and-goals

---
# What is a coroutine function?

Coroutine functions are functions that define a coroutine, using either the `async def` syntax or the `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator.

If you don't need to worry about backwards compatibility, you should almost always use  new-style coroutine functions that return native coroutine objects.

^ New-style coroutine functions are more readable and more explicit. The `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator doesn't actually enforce anything, and can be successfully applied to a non-coroutine function. You'll only find out the hard way when your program crashes.

---
# A very simple coroutine function

```python
import asyncio

async def hello():
    print('Hello Task!')

coroutine = hello()
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(coroutine)
```

^ If the `hello` function was not defined with `async def`, it would implicitly return `None`. Instead, it returns a coroutine object.

---
# Return values of coroutine functions

```python
import asyncio

async def add(x, y):
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return x + y

async def main():
    return_value = await add(4, 7)
    print(return_value)

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

^ You can only access the return value of a coroutine function inside another coroutine function, and only via the use of an `await` expression.

---
# What is a task?

In an event-loop-based program, you primarily use tasks instead of threads to implement concurrency.

"Donâ€™t directly create Task instances: use the `ensure_future()` function or the `AbstractEventLoop.create_task()` method."

^ Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task

^ The `asyncio.Task` class has a very similar API to that of the `concurrent.futures.Future` class.

---
# A simple task

```python
import asyncio

async def hello():
    print('Hello Task!')

asyncio.ensure_future(hello())
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
```

^ Here, the `asyncio.ensure_future()` function schedules the execution of the given coroutine object, wraps it in a task, and returns the task.

^ You should generally use `asyncio.ensure_future()` over `AbstractEventLoop.create_task()` since the former accepts any awaitable object, while the latter only accepts coroutine objects.

---
# Types of tasks we'll talk about today

- Asynchronous
- Synchronous (using ThreadExecutor)
- Inside web socket handler
- Inside a separate process

^ Note that from this point on, when we refer to a "task", we are talking about the general sense of the word, i.e. a long-running operation, as opposed to an instance of the `asyncio.Task` class.

---
# Asynchronous task

This is the simplest way to implement concurrency in an asyncio web app. You define the logic using a coroutine function, and schedule it using the `asyncio.ensure_future()` function. To send messages to the client, directly write to the websocket from inside your coroutine function.

---
# Task function

```python
async def long_task(writer):
    total = 150
    for i in range(1, total+1):
        writer.write(type='progress', value=i, total=total)
        print(i)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
```

---
# Muffin web app boilerplate

```python
import muffin
from muffin_playground import Application, WebSocketWriter

app = Application()
app.register_special_static_route()
```

^ `WebSocketWriter` is a very small convenience class that makes it easy to send JSON-encoded data through a websocket.

---
# The web socket request handler

```python
@app.register('/websocket/')
async def websocket(request):
    ws = muffin.WebSocketResponse()
    await ws.prepare(request)
    writer = WebSocketWriter(ws)

    async for msg in ws:
        if msg.data == 'start':
            coroutine = long_task(writer)
            task = asyncio.ensure_future(coroutine)

    return ws
```

^ In Muffin and aiohttp, the only difference between a normal request handler and a websocket request handler is that in the latter, a web socket response object is created.

^ Note the `async for` syntax. This was introduced in Python 3.5 along with the `async def` and `async with` syntax. In this example, the async for loop automatically terminates when the `WebSocketResponse` object receives a message of type `MSG_CLOSE`.

---
# Demo

- cd into `async_task_v1`
- Run program: `muffin app run`

---
# Client code

```python
jq = window.jQuery
ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5000/websocket/')

def on_click(evt):
    ws.send('start')

jq('button.start').on('click', on_click)
```

^ The client code here was written in Python, and compiled with [RapydScript](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/rapydscript-ng), a Python-to-JavaScript compiler. Note the new operator, which is special syntax that the RapydScript compiler supports.

^ We could've also used an Ajax call to start the task. But in this example, we want to receive messages from the websocket, so it makes more sense to send the 'start' message through the websocket (saving us from having to write another request handler).

---
### Client code, websocket message handler

```python
def on_message(evt):
  obj = JSON.parse(evt.data)
  print(obj)
  percent = obj['value'] / obj['total'] * 100
  jq('progress').val(percent)
  jq('.percent').text(str.format('{}%', percent.toFixed(0)))

ws.onmessage = on_message
```

^ Because RapydScript uses JS strings instead of Python strings, some of the familiar Python string methods are available as functions on the built-in `str` module.

---
# Adding the ability to cancel the task

Great, we can now start a long-running task from a web page! But, what if we want to give the user the ability to cancel the task?

The `asyncio.Task` class has a `cancel()` method, but we now need to keep a reference to the task object. This necessitates a pretty big refactoring.

---
## New web socket request handler

```python
@app.register('/websocket/')
class WSHandler(WebSocketHandler):
    async def on_open(self):
        self.task = None
        self.writer = WebSocketWriter(self.websocket)

    def task_done_callback(self, future):
        self.task = None

    # next slide
```

^ We now want to use a class instead of a function to handle this, because there are now callbacks involved. You could instead use inner functions but the code tends to be less readable.

---
## New web socket request handler (2)

```python
@app.register('/websocket/')
class WSHandler(WebSocketHandler):
    # previous slide

    async def on_message(self, msg):
        print(msg)
        if msg.data == 'start' and not self.task:
            self.task = asyncio.ensure_future(long_task(self.writer))
            self.task.add_done_callback(self.task_done_callback)
        elif msg.data == 'stop' and self.task:
            self.task.cancel()
```

^ This code not only allows you to stop the task, it also ensures that there is only one task running from a single websocket connection. You should to use `Task.add_done_callback()` here because you don't know exactly when the task will terminate. It's possible to use `await self.task` to wait until the task completes to do the cleanup, but that can lock up the handler for a long amount of time, preventing it from responding to other messages during the wait.

---
# Updated client code

```python
from wsclient import WsClient

class MyClient(WsClient):
    url = '/websocket/'
    auto_dispatch = True

    def on_progress(self, obj):
        print(obj)
        percent = obj['value'] / obj['total'] * 100
        jq('progress').val(percent)
        jq('.percent').text(str.format('{}%', percent.toFixed(0)))
```

^ The `WsClient` convenience class is provided by muffin-playground. It is made available for import because muffin-playground puts its resources directory on RapydScript's import path. Muffin-playground's resources directory contains a file called `wsclient.pyj`.

^ When the `auto_dispatch` attribute is set to `True`, the `WsClient` looks at the type property of a received message to decide which method should handle the message. In this case, all messages of type 'progress' will be dispatched to the `on_progress()` method.

---
# Demo

- cd into `async_task_v2`
- Run program: `muffin app run`

---
# Synchronous task

This is a way to take advantage of synchronous code or APIs that cannot be directly run by the asyncio event loop. This time, you define the logic inside a normal function, and have asyncio execute the function using a thread pool. You have to be more careful about writing to websockets because your task is running from another thread and asyncio methods are generally not thread safe.

---
# Task function

```python
def long_task(writer, stop_event):
    total = 150
    for i in range(1, total+1):
        if stop_event.is_set():
            return
        writer.write(type='progress', value=i, total=total)
        print(i)
        time.sleep(0.05)
```

---
# Launching the task

```python
stop_event = threading.Event()
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
coroutine = loop.run_in_executor(
  None,
  long_task,
  ThreadSafeWebSocketWriter(websocket),
  stop_event)
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coroutine)
task.add_done_callback(done_callback)
```

---
# The on_message() method

```python
async def on_message(self, msg):
    print(msg)
    if msg.data == 'start' and not self.task:
        self.task = self.execute_task(
            long_task,
            ThreadSafeWebSocketWriter(self.websocket),
            self.stop_event)
        self.task.add_done_callback(self.done_callback)
    elif msg.data == 'stop' and self.task:
        self.stop_event.set()
```

---
# Another demo

```
muffin app run
```

---
# Client code

The web socket code is exactly the same! Take a look at the button click handling code:

```python
jq = window.jQuery

jq('button.start').on('click', def(evt):
    client.send_text('start')
)
jq('button.stop').on('click', def(evt):
    client.send_text('stop')
)
```

---
# Web socket handler as a task

The web socket handler is essentially a task, since it runs for as long as the server maintains a `ws://` connection with the browser.

If you don't need the task to keep running after the web socket is closed, then this is a good solution.

---
# Task function

```python
async def fetch(page):
    if page >= 11:
        return None
    start = (page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE + 1
    end = start + PAGE_SIZE
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return [i for i in range(start, end)]
```

---
# The request handler function

```python
@app.register('/')
async def index(request):
    results = await fetch(1)
    return app.render('index.plim', results=results)
```

---
# The web socket handler function

```python
@app.register('/websocket/')
async def websocket(request):
    # ...
    page = 2
    while not ws.closed:
        results = await fetch(page)
        if results is None:
            break
        writer.write(type='results', value=results)
        page += 1
    # ...
```

---
# The last demo

```
muffin app run
```

---
# Client code

```python
class MyClient(WsClient):
    url = '/websocket/'
    auto_dispatch = True

    def on_results(evt, obj):
        print(obj)
        row = jq('<div class="result-row">').appendTo('.results')
        for v in obj['value']:
            jq('<div class="result">').text(v).appendTo(row)
```

# Some notes about the examples

- I'm using a project called [muffin-playground](https://github.com/feihong/muffin-playground), which provides convenience classes that reduce boilerplate code.
- Muffin-playground supports auto-compilation of these languages:
  - RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler (.pyj)
  - Plim template engine (.plim)
  - Stylus CSS preprocessor (.styl)

---
# Conclusion

- Asyncio makes it easy to work with tasks and web sockets
- Asyncio web app frameworks are ready for primetime (probably)
- Python in the browser is in an interesting place right now
