# Using Tasks in Your Asyncio Web App

## Introduction

In this talk, I will be talking about starting, stopping, and displaying incremental data from long-running tasks in an asyncio-based web application.

The examples for this talk were made to run on [muffin](https://github.com/klen/muffin), a high-level web framework built on top of [aiohttp](https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp).
